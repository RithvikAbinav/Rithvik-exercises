Write a program to find the distance between 2 points using functions.

Input Format:

Input consists of 4 integers. The first and second integer corresponds to the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the first point. The third and fourth integer corresponds to the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the second point.

Output Format:

Output consists of a single floating point number (correct to 2 decimal places.) Refer sample output for formatting details.

Sample Input:

3

6

4

3

Sample Output:

Distance between the 2 points is 3.16







#include <iostream>
#include<math.h>
using namespace std;
float dis(float x1, float x2, float y1, float y2)
{
    float a,b,c,d;
    float e;
    a=(y1-x1);
    b=a*a;
    c=(y2-x2);
    d=c*c;
    e=sqrt(b+d);
    return e;
}
int main()
{
    float a,b,c,d;
    cin>>a>>b>>c>>d;
    cout<<"Distance between the 2 points is ";
    printf("%0.2f",dis(a,b,c,d));
}
