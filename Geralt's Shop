When a customer asks for a new item he should check whether the item is already sold or it is available. If the item is not available it should display, "Out of stock". If it is there it should display remaining number of items available and the total cost that should be paid by a customer.

For eg: If customer asks 8 scales and only 3 scales are available, display "Only 3 scale are available"
