Wind chill factor is the felt air temperature on exposed skin due to wind. The wind chill temperature is always lower than the air temperature, and is calculated as per the following formula.
wcf = 35.74 + 0.6215t + (0.4275t - 35.75) * v^0.16
Write a program to receive values of temperature and wind velocity and calculate wind chill factor.

INPUT FORMAT: 

The input consists of two integers. 

The first integer corresponds to the temperature of the wind

The second integer corresponds to the wind velocity. 

OUTPUT FORMAT: 

The output consists of a single integer which corresponds to the Wind Chill Factor. 

Decimal values are rounded off to two decimal points.

Sample Input
35

20

Sample Output

23.92




#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
#include<cmath>
#include<stdio.h>

{
    int t,v,w;
    float wcf;
    cin >> t >> v;
    wcf = 35.74 + 0.6215*t + (0.4275*t - 35.75) * pow(v,0.16);
    printf("\n%.2f",wcf);
    return 0;
